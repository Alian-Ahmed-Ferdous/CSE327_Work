	<h3>1.	Introduction</h3>
<h4>1.1	Purpose</h4>
<p>This document goes an in-depth description of the functionality, operations, and constraints under which, 
    this software, Grasp, will perform, the platform on which will operate, 
    and its interface and interaction with its different users, in order to fulfil its intended purpose.
    This document is for the developers of this software.</p>

<h4>1.2 Document Conventions</h4>
<p>The IEEE srs standard was followed.</p>

<h4>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
<p>
    This document’s primary intended audience is the software developers. 
    The different users (Teachers and students) can read the introduction and system features for better understanding.
</p>
<h4>1.4 Product Scope</h4>
<p>
    Grasp is a reading evaluation software that aids teachers through active monitoring of students while 
    they read the assigned work and grading their attentiveness for the teacher’s assessment. 
    It also supports optional comprehension tests the teacher can assign along with the reading assignment, 
    with each question paired with a portion of the reading assignment. 
    The question can be of three types: where students type answers, students, answer through audio recording and MCQs. 
    The teacher can assign answers to the questions, using which Grasp can check the answers of the students. 
    All the scores of attentiveness and comprehension tests will be available to the teacher in the report section.

<h3>2.	Overall Description</h3>
<h4>2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
<p>
    Grasp is a self-contained software which helps teachers easily observe how students are 
    engaging with the reading material and optionally check their comprehension via tests.
</p>

<h4>2.2 Product Functions</h4>
<p>
    Teacher:

    <ul>
        <li>Create a cohort of students based on email</li>

        <li>Create cohorts within a cohort</li>

<li>Assign Reading assignments to cohorts by uploading pdf</li>

<li>Option to assign tests with the reading assignments with each question assigned to a part of the reading assignment.</li>

<li>Edit or delete assignments and/or tests</li>

<li>View report of the performance of the reading assignments and optional test of each student and each cohort</li></ul>

Student:

<ul><li>Complete the assigned reading assignment</li>

<li>Complete the optional test which might be assigned with the reading assignment</li></ul>
</p>

<h4>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Teacher: can create a cohort, assign reading assignments, assign optional tests with reading assignments, and view reports of student performance.</li>
    <li>Student: Can complete assignments and optional tests.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.4 Operating Environment</h4>
<p>
    It is a web-based application, thus, any latest internet browser such as chrome or firefox is required to run the application. 
    The companion android application requires a device that can run android 7.0 or above.
</p>
<h4>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The web application must be accessible through latest internet browsers and the companion mobile application must run on devices with Android 7.0 os.
        </li>
        <li>The website frontend will be build using react js and the frontend of the companion mobile application using java. The backend will us laravel php and the database will be a relational database, specifically Mysql. Everything will be hosted on railway. The backend and the frontend will communicate via api calls.</li>
        <li>Functions such as image comparing, text comparing, speech to text, and converting pdf contents to workable text will be implemented by using external api and libraries.</li>
        <li>The pdf uploaded for the reading assignment must be in pdf format with only one column and no images. The student must not be able to download the pdf.</li>
        <li>The user authentication will be handled via Google OAuth. Incase of student, an additional photo will also be collect via webcam on sign up. And everytime a student logs in, a new picture will be taken via webcam to compare with the previously collected picture to verify the student’s identity.</li>
        <li>In all occasion where the student must appear infornt of the webcam s/he must sit up straight facing, with their chest and face parallel to the camera and fully in frame of the camera.</li>
        <li>The companion android application will only send notifications of assignment start date and before end date. And the teachers will only be able to view report.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.6 User Documentation</h4>
<p>A user manual will be provided with the software one for the teachers and another for the students, on how to use the software.</p>

<h4>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
<p>
    Teachers and students are assumed to be internet literate, with experience of interacting with modern websites. 
    The students and teachers must also have one of the latest web browsers (chrome or firefox) on their device and an android device with android 7.0 os.
</p>

<h3>3.	External Interface Requirements</h3>
<h4>3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
<p>
    There will be a login/sign-up screen. If it's the teacher they will see a list of cohorts with a button to create new cohorts. If no cohort exists only the created cohort will appear. upon clicking on a cohort a list of reading assignments will appear with a button to edit or create reading assignments. If there are no reading assignments only create reading assignments will appear. On clicking the edit or create reading assignment button forms with relevant fields will appear. Create test button will be available in create reading assignment form. 
    Upon clicking Create test button relevant form with relevant fields will appear through which a test can be created. 
    There is a report button next to each assignment upon clicking teachers can see the report of the assignment and test. <br>

Students will see a list of cohorts they are in. Upon clicking a cohort they will see a list 
of assignments which they can complete and also complete tests if provided by the teacher. <br>

Here are some examples of what it’ll roughly look like:
<img src="images/image1.png">
<img src="images/image2.png">
<img src="images/image3.png">
<img src="images/image4.png">
</p>

<h4>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
<p>
    A laptop or desktop that can support the latest web browsers (chrome or firefox) along with a 
    webcam mounted as close to the top of the monitor as possible and 
    in front of the eyes, and a device that runs android 7.0 os. 
    All devices must be able to connect to the internet.
</p>

<h4>3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
<p>
    The database used will be MySQL. Any laptop/desktop operating system which can run the latest internet browsers is required and an 
    android device with android 7.0 os. Data transfer will occur 
    through API calls between systems as well as external APIs and libraries will be used.
</p>

<h4>3.4 Communications Interfaces</h4>
<p>
    An Internet connection is required at all times for the application to work and update. 
    All users will use a Gmail account to login in and sign up. 
    External and internal API calls will occur between the backend and frontend.
</p>
